# CookWithDal

CookWithDal is an innovative recipe-sharing app designed for Dalhousie students. With a focus on ease and convenience, this app allows students to share recipes, create shopping lists based on the ingredients needed for each recipe, and even track the nutritional information of the dishes they prepare. Students can discover new, quick-to-make recipes with minimal ingredients or share their favourite regional delicacies with fellow students.

## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this lab / assignment / project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

You will need to install any web browser (Chrome, Firefox etc).  
You will also need to install nodeJs.

### Installing

A step-by-step series of steps that tell you how to get a development env running:

1. Clone GIT repo

a. Firstly clone the GIT repository to your local machine.
b. Take the code of the main branch.

2. Install nodejs

a. Install nodejs from https://nodejs.org/en/.

3. Run the application.

a. Go to the directory of the app where package.json lies.
b. Run the command "npm install". It will install dependencies. It will build the node_modules folder.
c. Then run the command "npm start". It will run on localhost and you would be able to see the staff management page in the web browser.

4. Production-ready build.

## Features Developed - Profile Account Management (Owner - Faiza Umatiya)

Profile Account Management feature enables user to make changes in their personal information/user details. I implemented this feature which allows users to do various task like update user details, display their profile on profile page and also gives privilege to delete the user account. One can see this feature under profile page on "CookWithDal". On Profile page, user clicks on "Edit profile" to update details such as First name, Last name, Bio (about user such as hobby, location etc) and profile picture. Apart from this, user can see his/her "created" and "saved" recipes. "Created" recipes can be seen after user adds the recipe (dependent feature - Add Recipe). "Saved" recipes is visible once the user bookmarks/saved recipe (dependent feature - Bookmark Recipe). Lastly, the user can delete the profile from the profile page. So if user wants to login, he/she can't do that because that account does'nt exist anymore.
